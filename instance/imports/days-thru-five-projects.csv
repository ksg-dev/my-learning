fizzbuzz,"You are going to write a program that automatically prints the solution to the FizzBuzz game. These are the rules of the FizzBuzz game:
Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn and include number 100.
But when the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print ""Fizz"".
When the number is divisible by 5 then instead of printing the number it should print ""Buzz"".`
And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print ""FizzBuzz""",loops,https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/learn/quiz/6453979#overview,11/1/2024,11/1/2024,Day 5,Coding Exercise: 6,small-projects,for loop+if+CLI+modulo,100 Days of Code
